# Multi-Language School repo

Each language has its **own branch**

- `html-css` → HTML & CSS  
- `javascript` → javascript
- `php` → php
- `proj-prg-2` → future branch for the project
- `main` → don't care, it's just for the Github activity chart

I don't wanna have more than one repository for one subject
